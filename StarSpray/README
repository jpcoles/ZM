About StarSpray 
---------------

StarSpray is an interactive 3D particule simulator. Particles are placed in 3D world
and then allowed to collapse under their mutual gravitational attraction.

StarSpray is designed with a client-server architecture. The graphical interface
is run on the client and connects to the server, which runs the simulation software.
The two programs can be run on the same machine if desired.

USAGE
-----

    starspray-server <port>

    <port> is any freely available port value >= 1024 and <= 65536
    

    starspray <server> <port>

    The IP address of the server to connect to with the same port number as
    given to the server. If the server is running on the same machine as the
    client, then the IP address can be given as 127.0.0.1


    StarSpray assumes the presence of a 3D mouse, although a 2D mouse can be
    used with limited functionality. Only the SpaceNavigator from 3DConnexion
    has been tested:

PKDGRAV
-------

    PKDGRAV is the simulation program used to calculate the movement of the 
    particles. This version is time limited because a final release has not
    yet been made public. It is intended to be used solely with StarSpray. 


ADDITIONAL OPTIONS
------------------

    In addition to the server and port values (which must be given first),
    StarSpray accepts a number of other commandline options.

    --photo-path=PATH           The path to look for photos to lens
    --bcolor="black"
    --bcolor="white"            Choose a background color of black or white
    --fullscreen                Turn on fullscreen mode


CONTROLS
--------

    While running StarSpray, the following controls are available. The keys
    specified below can be changed by editing keys.h and recompiling. 
    Input can be given in upper or lower case.

    Key                 Description
    ---                 -----------

    SPACE               Move the camera around the simulation. This
                        helps discern the location of the particles better
                        in 3-space.

    R                   Run the simulation. StarSpray will transfer the
                        current particle position/velocity data to the server
                        and wait for the server to send the next frame back.
                        By default, only 1500 steps will be run. This can
                        be changed by setting env.maxTimesteps to a different
                        value in client.c

    S                   Stop the simulation.

    P                   Pause the simulation.

    X                   Clear the screen. This can only be done if the 
                        simulation is completely stopped (not paused).

    L                   Lens the newest file in the path given with the
                        --photo-path option.

    CMD-Q               Quit


NOTES
-----

    The number of particles that can be placed at once limited by the value of
    env.maxParticles in main.c. This is 10,000 by default. A number should be
    chosen such that there is minimal strain on the system running the simulation.
